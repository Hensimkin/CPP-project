Museum Management System
Welcome to the Museum Management System, a C++ project built using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. This application offers an efficient way to manage a museumâ€™s artwork collection and artist information, making museum administration smooth and organized.

Key Features
Add Artworks: Easily add new artworks to the museum's collection. Each piece can include details such as title, artist, creation date, type, and more.
Manage Artists: Register artists with the system, linking their information to relevant artworks, and build a comprehensive artist directory.
Print Collection: View the entire collection with one click, providing a well-organized display of all current artworks and artists.
Delete Artworks: Keep the collection curated by removing artworks as needed.
This project is designed with clean code practices, efficient data handling, and modular functions, making it a great example of OOP in action with C++.
